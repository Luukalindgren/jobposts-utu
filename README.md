## Overview

This repository serves as a showcase for a Jobposts Website developed during my tenure as a Research Assistant at the University of Turku. This web application was designed to provide statistics of gathered IT job posts, and also allows researchers to export the data for further research.

## Project Description

The Jobposts Website is a comprehensive web application that enables users to:

- Browse through IT job post data that is crawled from 29.08.2023 onwards.
- See summaries, trends, and statistics of these job posts.
- Export the dataset with filters for further research.

  
## Development

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React.js, Vite, Recharts
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Crawler**: Python, BeatifulSoup
- **Database**: MariaDB
- **Authentication**: Bcrypt
- **Hosting**: Docker, UTU's virtual server


## Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort with my coworker William Lempinen. We worked closely throughout the project lifecycle, from planning and development to testing and deployment.
